## General Overview

Since I have been learning the fundamentals of full stack development, I decided I would build my own wedding registry website using MongoDB, Express, React and Node JS.

The website features a `Home` page which displays an image of the couple with a navbar that navigates to all the respective pages of the application. The `FAQs` page features a blog post that answers frequently asked questions by guests, offers further information about the wedding registry and provides links to my LinkedIn page. The `Registry` page features three links to shop for furniture, home decor or kitchen items respectively. Each link features an assortment of items based on the category chosen and guests would have the option of adding or removing an item to their cart. The `Checkout` page shows all items added to the carts and allows users to fill in vital information and check out their chosen items. After checkout is completed, the guests are taken to a `Leave a message` page where they can write messages to the couple, update an existing message they had left, or delete a current message they had posted.

## FrontEnd

For the frontend, HTML, CSS, React and Node JS would be used to display and design the interface.

## BackEnd

For the backend, MongoDB and Express would be used.

## Future Updates

Following this first phase, details would be added to build the rest of the pages, and eventually, a template could possibly be made for newlyweds to plan their destination wedding. The main functionality could be a customized wedding, eulogy, tribute... website for people to share messages and upload pictures for an event, party etc, which could then be turned into a physical or digital photoalbum/scrapbook for keepsake.
