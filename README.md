## General Overview

Since I have been learning the fundamentals of full stack development, I decided I would build my own wedding website using MongoDB, Express, React and Node JS.

The focus of the first phase of this project would be the virtual guest signing book. The `Guestbook` would render a `Form` which allows the user post an image or images. Once the image is submitted, the `PostImage` page would render a `PostGreeting` page. If the user posts a greeting for the couple, that page renders a `Greetings` page that shows all the greetings from all the guests, which is visible to every user that logs into the site.

## FrontEnd

For the frontend, HTML, CSS, React and Node JS would be used to display and design the interface.
The `Nav` bar would nest 6 menu items, which would be designed using React, and the rest of the menu items would be displayed at the end of the Nav Bar.

## BackEnd

For the backend, MongoDB and Express would be used.

## Future Updates

Following this first phase, details would be added to build the rest of the pages, and eventually, a template could possibly be made for newlyweds to plan their destination wedding, and provide their guests a place to sign a guest book post the wedding, and upload images of the wedding.
